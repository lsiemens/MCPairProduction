# Sources for the physics and algorithms #
The sources used for the computational project and required research.

## Physics ##
- Introduction to Elementary Particles by Griffiths (Primary source, course text)
- Quarks and Leptons: An Introductory Course in Modern Particle Physics by Halzen
- Modern Particle Physics by Thomson (if I can get access)

## Algorithms ##
- Computational Physics: Problem Solving with Python by Landau
- Computation In Modern Physics by Gibbs
- A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python by Langtangen (intreductory but might have usefull intro to Monte Carlo)
