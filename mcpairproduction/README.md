# MCPairProduction


## tauon pair production
Use Monte Carlo sampeling to simulate the counts of Tauon particles from
a particle accelerator.

### constants
Physical constants from PDG and related helper functions

### scattering
Differential cross section functions

### sampling
Functions for sampling the domain and Monte Carlo methods

### accelerator
Determine luminosity, run and record simulation

### analysis
Analize data sets

## totcross
The first part of the project to estimate the estimate the total cross
section of a scattering interaction of the form e⁻ + e⁺ →  f + f̄.
