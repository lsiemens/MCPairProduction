"""Simulate particle accelerator

Setup and run Monte Carlo simulations of a particle accelerator using the
center of momentum frame for a single process. The simulation procedure
is as follows,

    Use Monte Carlo integration and Monte Carlo sampling to simulate
    scattering events at a fixed energy. The total cross section œÉ is
    estimated using Monte Carlo integration. The expected number of
    scattering events, N_e, is given by the equation,

    N_e = œÉ ùìõ_int

    Where œÉ is the total cross section and ùìõ_int is the time integrated
    luminosity. Asumming the scattering events occur randomly with a
    constant frequency, then the number of events expected within a
    fixed time interval is described by a Poisson distribution. Generate
    a random number N from a Poisson distribution, with mean N_e, to use
    as the number of scattering events during a run. Use rejection
    sampling to generate N samples of random angles from the distribution
    given by the differential cross section. The magnitude of the
    3-momentum of the outgoing particle is,

    p = sqrt(E¬≤ - m¬≤)

    where E is the energy of the particle and m is the mass of the
    particle. Data entries are saved as (E, p, Œ∏, œÜ). The processes being
    simulated are planer (since there are two outgoing particles) and the
    distribution is uniform in the azimuthal angle, so with out loss of
    generality œÜ = 0.

Note, internal calculations use natural units with ƒß=c=1. Energies are
in units of MeV if not otherwise specified.
