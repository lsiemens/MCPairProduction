# MCPairProduction

MCPairProduction is the result of my computational project for Phys 424
(particle physics) at UVic. This project contains modules and scripts to
simulate muon pair production by positron electron anihilation at the LEP.

Documentation is avaliable via docstrings for most methods and functions.
This documelntation is also avaliable on the [Project page](https://lsiemens.com/MCPairProduction).
